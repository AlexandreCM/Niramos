!!! MAYOR CHANGES: Changed main layout construction methodology.
!!! VoltageInternalConstruction added to the framework. This class will be present across all base classes of Voltage (VoltageWindow, VoltageEditor, VoltageHelper)
!!! From now on to code your UI you need to access the Constructor property. All AreaStart(), Field(), Label(),etc. will need to be accessed with Constructor.AreaStart(), Constructor.Field(),Constructor.Label(), Constructor.Etc().


- VoltageInternalConstructor: Used to manage Stored and Wild elements more compehensively.
Use Constructor.StartStoredConstructor(myArea) to change focus to myArea and start constructing its Stored Layout. Use Constructor.EndStoredConstructor to finalize.

- VoltageBuilder changed name to VoltageHelper
- VoltageHelper: now can call other VoltageHelpers.
- SplitArea fixed issue with tracking mouse position when inside other areas.

- WeightArea: fixed eventCall for storedElements
- WeightArea: fixed DrawCall for storedElements
- StreamArea fixed eventCall for storedElements

- VoltageStyles: VoltageStyles is now deprecated and was replaces by Styles and StyleBundle.
- Styles: used to manage your bundles. Previous VoltageStyles.GetStyle should be replaced by Styles.GetStyle(styleID). Now you can access other StyleBundles on "Assets/Splime/Voltage Style Bundles/" folder using Styles.GetStyle(bundleName,styleID).
- StyleBundle: manage different styles and organize them within different bundles. Create a new bundle on the right click "Create" menu on the Project Manager. Place your bundles under "Splime/Voltage Style Bundles" to be able to edit them through the Voltage Style Editor.
- Style Editor: added functionality to use multiple StyleBundles.
